# Get Playlist Data (Python Bot)

This python bot allows your computer to fetch data, such as audio files and synced lyrics from a specific spotify playlist automatically!

### Environmental Variables

-   _PLAYLIST_ID_: The id of the Spotify playlist you want to scrape
-   _TOKEN_: The Spotify API token to get the track data
-   _OUTPUT_DIR_: The directory where the data is outputted (I recommend 'out')
